Welcome! This repository contains the source material for the open-source textbook **"Reproducible Research Using R"**. This project serves as a comprehensive guide to performing statistical analysis and creating transparent, reproducible reports.

## 🚀 The Migration
This project was recently migrated from **R Markdown** to **Quarto**. This move allows for better multi-format rendering (HTML, EPUB) and a more robust workflow for reproducible science.

## 📖 Contents
The book covers a full curriculum of data science and statistics:
- **Foundations:** Introduction to R and the `tidyverse`.
- **Analysis:** Visualizations, Comparing Groups (T-tests/ANOVA), and Categorical Analysis.
- **Modeling:** Linear and Logistic Regression.
- **Reporting:** Advanced reproducible reporting workflows.

## 🛠 How to Render Locally

2. Open `Reproducible-Research-R.Rproj` in RStudio.
3. In the "Build" tab, click **Render Book**, or run the following in your terminal:
   ```bash
